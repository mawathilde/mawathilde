# 👋 Hi there! I'm Mawa

Full-stack developer, generalist by heart and curious by design.
If it's code, I'm probably poking at it!

## 🧪 A bit about me

- 🛠️ I enjoy building things from scratch - apps, tools, even the occasional game mod.
- 🔍 I'm always exploring new tech like it's a side quest I can't skip.
- 🎮 I like mixing code with creativity, especially when it involves pixels or plants.

## ✨ Featured Project

### 🧙 Wizards Story  

A modded Minecraft RolePlay server set in an alternate Harry Potter universe (circa 1889, Ilvermorny-inspired), built for deep RP immersion and custom features: spells, broom flying, magical creatures, potions, Quidditch and more.

I’ve been part of the project since its launch in December 2019 - developed core mods (spellcasting, broom flight, Quidditch), and set up automated server deployment via GitHub Actions.
